# Telegram Clone Bot

A Python script to clone content (messages, media) from one Telegram channel to another using the Pyrogram library.

U NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE PYROGRAM TO USE THIS LIBRARY
pip install Pyrogram

!!!ALSO DURING THE DEVELOPMENT I GOT THE SPAM BLOCK!!!
SO USE WITH UR OWN RESPONSIBILITY


to get API use this: https://my.telegram.org/auth

**Clone the repository**:

git clone https://github.com/Venius24/telegram-channel-copy.git


**Warning**

Before using this code u should change every config in keys.py

I don't recommend to change length of delay because other time causes FloodWait error that incorrectly solves
